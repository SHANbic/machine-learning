# machine-learning

At last but not least, here comes machine learning ! And to be honest, I did not enjoy it as much I thought I would :(:(

This is only a little introduction to what is machine learning, but still I was really eager to get my hands dirty and it turned out the course wasnt that great. Anyways, here is how you can try out:
```terminal
 python3 -m pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.12.0-py3-none-any.whl
 ```
 A little bit surprising huh? When i tried to install tensorflow, I got an error and stackoveflow told me to paste this command in my terminal, and I did, turns out it worked.

 You also need this:
 ```terminal
 pip3 install -U keras opencv-python
 ```

And this:
```terminal
pip3 install imageai --upgrade
```

Then you'll need a model type to perform predictions, and here the one we're using, [SqueezeNet](https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/squeezenet_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5) (around 5 mb)

Once you're done, you can run the program and try to modify the image to test (feel free to use any image you like). Fun thing, you'll see that the predictions are nothing but fails. I guess you understand why I didn't enjoy the course that much, fun:0 - 1:fail

I'll give machine learning another try in a few days, there are so many possibilities that I dont want to believe I'm done with it. Have a really nice day :)
